We can do this by adding our new model to the Pi and running it the same way we ran the existing model. To do this:</p>\n\n<p>1. Open cyberduck and drag-n-drop the unzipped model folder you downloaded from the teachable machine website into the 'models' file. Make sure the name of the folder represents your model so you can easily identify it later on.</p>\n\n<p>2. Open PuTTY and SSH into the Pi. Go inside the pi_camera_detection directory and type the following command:</p>\n\n<pre><code>nano predict.py\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Find the part where the <code>models</code> are defined. It is a <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_lists.asp\">list</a> of <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_tuples.asp\">tuples</a>. Add a new tuple to the end of the list with a name for your model and the directory it is stored in, for example</p>\n\n<pre><code>models = [fdafsd\n          (\"New Model\", \"new_model/\")]\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Now you can run the prediction program and test out your new model.</p>\n\n<p> </p>\n"},"library":"H5P.AdvancedText 1.1","metadata":{"contentType":"Text","license":"U","title":"Untitled Text","authors":[],"changes":[]},"subContentId":"11292f02-cf2a-44dd-8a3f-53d1dc6933fc"},"useSeparator":"auto"},{"content":{"params":{"introPage":{"showIntroPage":false,"startButtonText":"Start Quiz","introduction":""},"progressType":"dots","passPercentage":50,"questions":[{"params":{"media":{"disableImageZooming":false},"answers":[{"correct":true,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"","chosenFeedback":"","notChosenFeedback":""},"text":"<div>Yes and Yes</div>\n"},{"correct":false,"tipsAndFeedback":{"tip":"<p>Make sure you moved the right folder into Cyberduck.
