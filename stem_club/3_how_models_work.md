title: How do AI models work?

We have trained our own models, and found they have some limitations.  In this workshop we start understanding how our model is working so that we can learn how we can make it better!

Models from teachable machine are built via _transfer learning_ from _image net models_

TODO: we might need to make something of our own for this (unfortunately).
