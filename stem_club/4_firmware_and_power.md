# Get an SD card

Your facilitator will give you a stemclub firmware card.  Put the SD card into the Pi

# Add Power to the Pi

Your Pi can be powered from a wall wart or from a powerbank. 

SAs - get me a picture please

# The rainbow of success

Once the pi is connected to the power bank, the SenseHat will display a rainbow screen while it boots. The SenseHat will then go blank before displaying the letter ‘K’.  Congratulations, your Pi is working

# How long does your Pi last on the powerbank
Grab a powerbank, look on it to see how many milliamps it is.  Plug in your pi, start the happy snap command and wait.  Start a timer and see how long the Pi runs for.  Minutes?  Hours? Days? I suggest you put it somewhere you can keep an eye on it.

In your lab book, note the time you got for your powerbank and the number of milliamps in your powerbank (I hope it was full when you started).
