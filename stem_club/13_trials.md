# Plan a data collection session for between sessions

Designing our experiment is just as important as running the experiment so you should spend some time planning what data you want to collect.  Hint, you probably want to do something quite like what we did in the [data collection](/stem_club/12_data_collection.html) worksheet.

# Collect the data

Put your plan into action and collect a fresh set of data about the accuracy of your model.
