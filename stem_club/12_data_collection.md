# What is it bad at?

After the last workshop you should have some tasks the AI is good at but others it is bad at.  Write down in your lab book which categories are working well and which are not.

# Collect more data

Armed with that information, do another round of training.  Collect new training images and get them with Termius FTP.

# Add to Teachable Machine

Open up your existing project on the teachable machine website and add your new images into the right categories.  Retrain your model and download it again.

# Get new model down

Repeat the steps from [loading the model](/stem_club/10_loading_model.html) to get the updated model on your Pi.

{: .task}
## Predict
Make a prediction about how much better (or worse!) the new model will be.
