# Using a battery to give you portability, test the model

Make sure your pi is connected to a battery for power and go try it out!

# Be more careful with your testing and note down the details
Take notes on how accurate your model is.  Each step is:
  * Point the camera at something
  * Check what it's guess was
  * Write down what it was pointed at and what it's guess was.

Repeat this process over and over to create a table something like this
