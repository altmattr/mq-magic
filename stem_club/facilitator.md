Each session is designed to take about 30 minutes of class activity and for students to do some small amount of work themselves.

Each session should go something like this:
  1. Welcome and give preview of activity
  2. Students do the activity in small groups.  In the first week it is to watch a video, so you can all do that together, but in later weeks it will be group activities.
  3. Ask each student to please show you their lab book with their answers to this week's tasks.  If they have not completed it, they can do it before the next workshop please.

## Group vs Individual

Although the work is all done in groups, we would really like each student to write up their own lab books.  I expect everyone in the same group will write pretty-much the same thing, but that is no problem.

## Encouraging them to summarise their knowledge

You will have to keep going over the same thing over and over again.  For example, you will certainly have to show them multiple times how to connect to the Pi in field mode.  After a few times, encourage them to write down the steps in their lab book and/or to start making a cheat sheet.
