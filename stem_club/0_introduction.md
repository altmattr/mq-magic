title: Wildlife Identification via Machine Learning
---

A workshop designed for students in years 9/10 which will teach technical skills, problem solving, creative use of programming, machine learning, and data stewardship.  Students will create an artificial intelligence that can identify wildlife in the field.  The AI model will be deployed on embedded hardware in the field.  Students will customise the AI based on their location and target species.  Students will learn the skills to interact directly with embedded hardware and deploy low-power, high-performance systems.

This workshop was built with support from the [Google exploreCSR program](https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/), [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/02/exploreCSR-awards-highlights.html) and the NSW Government.

The worskhop contains 16 worksheets, each of which take about 30 minutes to complete with students expected to work independently in-between sessions:
  1. Teachable Machine
  1. Build a model
  1. Test the model
  1. What is the model doing (aka how does AI work)?
  1. Setting up the hardware
  1. Creating the firmware and Powering the Pi
  1. Controlling the Pi from the SenseHat
  1. Connecting to the Pi
  1. Controlling the Pi via command line
  1. Trying existing models
  1. Capturing Training Data
  1. Training your model online
  1. Loading a Model
  1. Testing the model
  1. Collecting Data
  1. Field Trials
  1. Presenting Results
