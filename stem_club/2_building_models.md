title: Build your own AI model
---

Last workshop you learned [about teachable machine](1_teachable_machine.html).  In this workshop you will train your own model.

# Group activity

Please form into gropus of 2 or 3 for this workshop.

Each of you should have written a classification task you want to do in your lab book.  Each group should choose one of these (or maybe combine different ideas) to complete in this workshop.

{: .task}
# Make a model
  * Head over to [teachable machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/)
  * "Get Started"
  * Train an image project

Pick a name for your model and make sure to "Save project to Google Drive". Write the name you chose in your lab book.

{: .task}
# Test your model

Try out the following variations:
 * move to a different location
 * try holding the item in a different orientation
 * have different people holding the items
 * try variants of the items

Note in your lab book which variants worked, and which ones did not.

In the next workshop we will combine what we learned about the models to try and understand how AI models like this work under the hoo.
