title: Teachable Machine
---

We begin by learning about the AI creation tool [teachable machine](https://blog.google/technology/ai/teachable-machine/) from Google.

Watch the following video from the Coding Train and then come back to answer the question in your log book.  Don't watch past 8 minutes and 56 seconds, we won't need any of that material.

# Pick a task
Pick a recognition task you would like to try.  Pick a task you will be able to do in the next session.  Write it down in your lab book and make a prediction about how many training images you will need.  Go back and watch how many Daniel did to get an idea.  

We will train a model in the next workshop based on your answer to task 2.  At least one person in each group will need to have a google account they can use to save their models.
