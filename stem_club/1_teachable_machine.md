Watch the following video from the Coding Train and then come back to answer the question in your log book.

What do you need to have access to if you want to make your own AI  with teachable machine?

# Pick a task
Pick a recognition task you would like to try.  Write it down in your lab book and make a prediction about how many training images you will need.  Go back and watch how many Daniel did to get an idea.  

We will train a model in the next workshop based on your answer to task 2.  At least one person in each group will need to have a google account they can use to save their models.
