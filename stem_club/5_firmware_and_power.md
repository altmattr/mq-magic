# Get an SD card

Your facilitator will give you a stemclub firmware card.  Put the SD card into the Pi

# Add Power to the Pi

Your Pi can be powered from a wall wart or from a powerbank.

# How long does your Pi last on the powerbank
Grab a powerbank, look on it to see how many milliamps it is.  Plug in your pi, start the happy snap command and wait.  Start a timer and see how long the Pi runs for.  Minutes?  Hours? Days? I suggest you put it somewhere you can keep an eye on it.

In your lab book, note the time you got for your powerbank and the number of milliamps in your powerbank (I hope it was full when you started).
