# How to present the results of your trial.

Anything you want to say about your model that _you_ find interesting will probably be interesting to others.

The key is to make the information _clear_ and _accurate_.

Pick a single "story" you want to tell about your model.  You could choose to communicate:
  * How accurate your model is
  * What thing affect your model
  * How many training images it took
  * Insights your had about how your model is operating.

Exaclty _how_ to present your results is also up to you, options are:
  * Powerpoint
  * OneNote
  * Paper and Pen!

By now we hope you have started to see the benefit of paper and pen and it is easy as well, so we recommend that option.
