# [Lesson 1: Teachable Machine](#lesson-1)
## Activity Sequence

| **Activity** | **Strategies** | **Time needed** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Watch video | Whole class or individual | 9 minutes | Students either on their own devices or via a projector will watch ~9 minutes of a youtube video, taking notes regarding the two questions on the lesson page |
| Task 1 | Individual or group work | 10 minutes | Students are asked to complete task 1 and list resources needed to create a model on teachable machine |
| Task 2 | Individual, group work | 10 minutes | Students choose one of the model options from teachable machine to work on next session, and answer the question posed in task 2. Students also ensure that at least one group member has a google account for next session |

## Criteria for/Indicators of success
* Students can demonstrate understanding of and predict the resources required to create an image recognition model using the teachable machine platform

## Required resources for lesson 
Resources required for this lesson:
* Laptop/Projector for watching video
*	Internet access
Task One: Resources
*	Lab book
*	Laptop with internet access for teachable machine
Task Two: Pick a task
*	Lab book
*	Laptop with internet access for teachable machine

# [Lesson 2: Building Models](#lesson-2)
## Activity Sequence

| **Activity** | **Strategies** | **Time needed** | **Description** |
|--------------|----------------|------------------|----------------|
| Form Groups | Groups | 3 minutes | Students should form into groups of 2 or 3. They should then select one of the classification tasks based on the choices written in their lab books |
| Task 1 | Group work | 10 minutes | Groups will use the device of the group member who will save the model to their google account, and start to create a model from their chosen classification. They are given ten minutes to get set up, add classes and samples to their models. |
| Task 2 | Group work | Rest of lesson | Students are instructed to save their model to google drive. They should then train the model, and once it is trained they should begin testing the model in different locations, different orientations, different group members holding items, and variations of the items. During this process, group members should take note in their lab books as to which variations worked and which didnâ€™t.  |

## Criteria for/Indicators of success
* Students demonstrate some understanding of the process and some ability to create machine learning classification models
* Students can evaluate the effectiveness of their models in correctly classifying inputs


## Required resources for lesson 
Resources required for this lesson:
* Laptop with functional webcam and internet access (1 per group)
* Google account (1 per group)
* Lab book (each student)
