title: Collecting Training Data
---

We will use the Pi to collect training data.  You can choose if you want to collect with happy snaps ("H" command) or with training capture ("T" command)

## Collecting with happy snaps

Walk around and take pictures of things for your training data.  Make sure you capture lots of positive and negative cases.

## Collecting with training capture

Using the "T" command on the sense hat, your Pi will automatically start collecting an image every 1 second.  Walk around collecting positive and negative images for training with.
