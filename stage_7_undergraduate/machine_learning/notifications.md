# Indicating which class is currently predicted

At the moment, we are using the terminal to indiate the results of the running predictor.  However, _in the field_ we might like the Pi to somehow indicate, even when it is not connected to anything.  We have provided some hardware you can experiement with.

It is up to you now to explore the capabilities of the hardware, device notification methods, and test the device even when not connected to a network.
