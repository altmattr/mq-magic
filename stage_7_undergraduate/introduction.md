---

These activities to mentor students from _learners_ to _researchers_ and to connect them with peers in industry and research careers.

These activities occur with support from the [Google exploreCSR program](https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/) and [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/02/exploreCSR-awards-highlights.html).

# Ready for Research Workshop

  * **When**: Feb 15th - Feb 17th 2023
  * **Where**: 4 Research Park Drive, Macquarie University
  * **Price**: Free (funded through the exploreCSR Program)
  * **Register**: Register by emailing Matt Roberts (matthew.roberts@mq.edu.au)

A workshop designed specifically  for students from under-represented groups.  Unlock the world of research and meet research professionals.  Attendees will be also invited to the [working lunch](/stage_7_undergraduate/working_lunch.hhml) held in December each year.

Leap-frog your peers and learn the skills to unlock the world of computer science research.   We will take research systems and improve them using skills from:

  * Linux
  * Command Line
  * Git
  * Programming
  * Graphics and Visualisations
  * Machine Learning

Over three days you will learn how to use these tools, tools that put you completely in control of your computer and that let you push the boundaries of software technology.

The workshop is open to any high-achieving undergraduate from under-represented groups who have completed at least one programming course at University.

The workshop will run on-campus at Macquarie University but students from any University are welcome.

  * Women
  * Indigenous students
