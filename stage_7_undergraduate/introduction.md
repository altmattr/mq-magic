title: Getting Ready for Research
---

We have created a series of activities to mentor students from _learners_ to _researchers_ and to connect them with peers in industry and research careers.

These activities occur with support from the [Google exploreCSR program](https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/) and [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/02/exploreCSR-awards-highlights.html).
