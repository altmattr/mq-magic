Stem Club was developed for students from under-represented groups and is delivered to those students with the support of the New South Wales Governments.  However, the program is available to any school if they are able to contribute the cost of delivering the program.

Stem Club is:

  * Delivered on-site at high schools.
  * Appropriate for grades 9-11.
  * Inclusive and flexible to all student abilities and interests.

Stem Club has been designed specifically to scale with student interest.  It has been delivered to low SES schools where students had no prior exposure to STEM _and_ to high-achieving cohorts looking to extend the scope of what they can learn beyond the High-School curriculum.  Everyone enjoys it equally.

Stem Club can be delivered in multiple modes:
  
  * Two full school days (normal configuration).
  * 8 weeks of 2 hour sessions.

In the normal configuration, cost of delivery is $10,000 for a group of 24 students.  That cost covers:

  * All equipment including 8 AI cameras for the students to keep if they wish to continue working on the devices.
  * 4 University Academic Staff to run the sessions ensuring the students get plenty of attention.
  * University staff delivering on-site at the school.
  * Staff who are selected to relate with students and able to discuss career/study options in STEM.
  * Access to University Staff to plan and adjust the program for the school.
