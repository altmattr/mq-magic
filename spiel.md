# Macquarie University In-School STEM Club

The Macquarie University STEM Club was developed to engage secondary students from under-represented groups in STEM education, with support from the New South Wales Government. However, the program is available to any school able to contribute to the delivery cost.

## Stem Club Overview

STEM Club provides an interactive and educational experience where students:

  * Create a AI camera capable of recognising what it is taking photos of
  * Explore programming, AI, security, networking, electronics and engineering.
  * Gain hands-on experience with real technical skills in an engaging STEM environment.
  * Participate in sessions delivered on-site at their high school.
  * Are part of an inclusive and flexible learning experience suitable for students of all abilities and interests.
  * Engage in a program designed by engineers, educators, and diversity experts, balancing wide appeal with valuable skill development.

STEM Club has been designed specifically to scale with student interest. It has been delivered to low SES schools where students had no prior exposure to STEM _and_ to high-achieving cohorts looking to extend the scope of what they can learn beyond the High-School curriculum. All participants have responded positively.

The STEM Club worksheets are [available publicly here](/stem_club/0_introduction.html) to help schools assess the program's relevance to their students.

## Delivery Modes

STEM Club can be delivered in multiple formats to suit school preference:
  
  * **Two full school days** (standard configuration).
  * **8 weeks of 2 hour sessions.**
  * **Custom mode** to suit a particular school.
