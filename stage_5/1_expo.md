title: Machine Learning Demo with Teachable Machine
---

Students retrain an exising model to detect items in their current space.  Students try things that differ by alot, things that differ by a small amount, things that are large and things that are small.  The resulting artificial intelligence seems brilliant, until you start poking at the edges...

## Indigenous students exploring machine learning in 2022

Students found that:
  * attempts to train the AI to recognise a face would only get an AI that recognised where that person sat
  * pens are too small for any AI to accurately find in this space
  * the inception model for imagenet has a lot of strange ideas
  * imagenet models are obsessed with colour
