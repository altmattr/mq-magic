title: Bridging the Gap
---

Postgraduate initiatives aim to _bridge the gap_ between undergraduate study and postgraduate research.  Many students consider undergraduate study, but for people from underepresented groups the jump to postgraduate can be hard.  Financial support, connections to reseachers, help choosing topics and postgraduate schools are all more needed for females and indigenous students.

These activities occur with support from the [Google exploreCSR program](https://research.google/outreach/explore-csr/) and [TensorFlow](https://blog.tensorflow.org/2022/02/exploreCSR-awards-highlights.html).
