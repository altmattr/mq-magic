An opportunity for outstanding graduating students to spend a summer working on research projects under the mentorship of computing academics.

Project begin in January, run through Februrary. Students recieve $AUD7000 for 4 weeks work on-campus at an Australian University.

Applications are open to any female or indigenous student who will complete a Computing, Information Technology, Science, Software Engineering, or related degree in the year they are applying or the year they are awarded the scholarship.

Students interseted in applying should contact Matthew Roberts (matthew.roberts@mq.edu.au) before Jan 1 2022.

### Formal Methods for Control Systems with Dr Matthew Roberts

_Awarded to Helene Cannon_

The student will contribute to the ongoing work applying axiomatic and constructive proofs of stability to the PX4 autopilot system.

### Language Support for Quantitative Information Theory with Dr Natasha Fernandez

_Awarded to Jessica Dalmati_

The student will translate QIF research demonstrations into the Kuifje programming language, identify features that should be added to Kuifje, and prototype those changes.

### Implementing Control Software in Dafny

_Awarded to Xinyi (Kayla) Li_

In this project we will explore how well Dafny can be used to model a control system and whether Dafny's underlying proof system can support stability proofs on that controller.  We will do this by implementing the control system described in "From control systems to control software" by Feron in [Dafny](https://dafny.org/).
